```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
```

## 2️⃣ Install dependencies

## 3️⃣ Create an .env file

Create a .env file in the root folder and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

## 🧠 How It Works

User enters a city name and clicks the Search button.

The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live data.

It extracts the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition icon.

The weather information and matching icon are displayed dynamically.

If the input is empty or invalid, a toast notification appears
